# GameBundle Spring

This is the backend repository for the GameBundl project.

GameBundl was built with React and Spring, and hosted on Azure. A CI/CD pipeline for GameBundl was implemented in Azure DevOps with Azure Pipelines. The application was hosted on Azure, with data hosted in Azure SQL Server.

The GameBundl project was a training project created to get better familiarized with React, Spring, and Azure cloud hosting.

The application implements a concept idea of a digital game sales platform that allows for customers to build custom video games bundles. By adding your first game to a bundle, you'll be able to see other games you can add with it to get an overall discount on all the games in your bundle, and how much that discount is. As a user, I can view my saved bundles, and build new ones.
